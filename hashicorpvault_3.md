Got it! Let me explain **Vault policies** in an **easy, software-professional way** — no unnecessary complexity, just the essentials you need to understand and use them effectively.

---

## 🔑 What Are Vault Policies?

### **Definition:**

A Vault **policy** is a set of rules that defines:

1. **Who can access what** in Vault (specific paths).
2. **What actions** they can perform (read, write, delete, etc.).

---

## 🌟 Key Points to Know:

1. **Policies are mandatory** in Vault — they are how Vault enforces access control.
2. Policies control **which paths** a user or app can access.
3. You assign policies to:

   * **Tokens**
   * **AppRoles** (e.g., Jenkins/Terraform integration)
   * **Authentication methods** (e.g., GitHub login)

---

## 🛠 Common Capabilities in Policies

| **Capability** | **What It Means**                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `read`         | View the secret value.           |
| `list`         | See all the keys in a path.      |
| `create`       | Add a new secret.                |
| `update`       | Modify an existing secret.       |
| `delete`       | Remove a secret.                 |
| `sudo`         | Full access (admin-level power). |

---

## 🔧 Policy Syntax (HCL Format)

Here’s what a basic policy looks like:

```hcl
# Example: Developer Policy
path "aws/creds/dev-role" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "secret/data/dev/*" {
  capabilities = ["read", "list", "create", "update"]
}
```

### Breakdown:

* `path`: Specifies where the policy applies.
* `capabilities`: Lists what the user can do (read, write, etc.).

---

## 📦 Real-World Example: Developer Use Case

Let’s say:

* Your **Dev team** needs to:

  * Read dynamic AWS keys.
  * Manage app secrets under `secret/data/dev/`.
* You create this policy:

```hcl
path "aws/creds/dev-role" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

path "secret/data/dev/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update", "read", "delete", "list"]
}
```

---

## 🔗 How to Use Policies in Vault

1. **Write the policy** to Vault:

   ```bash
   vault policy write dev-policy dev-policy.hcl
   ```

2. **Attach the policy** to an entity, like:

   * **AppRole**:

     ```bash
     vault write auth/approle/role/dev-team token_policies="dev-policy"
     ```
   * **Token**:

     ```bash
     vault token create -policy="dev-policy"
     ```
   * **GitHub team**:

     ```bash
     vault write auth/github/map/teams/dev value="dev-policy"
     ```

---

## 🧩 How Policies Work

1. A user or app logs in to Vault.
2. Vault checks:

   * What **policies** are attached to their token or role.
   * Does the policy allow access to the requested path and action?
3. If yes → Access is granted.
   If no → Access is denied.

---

## 💼 Example: Managing Teams in Vault

| **Team**       | **Path**               | **Capabilities**        | **Policy Name**  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Developers** | `aws/creds/dev-role`   | `read`                  | `dev-policy`     |
|                | `secret/data/dev/*`    | `read`, `write`, `list` | `dev-policy`     |
| **Admins**     | `*` (all paths)        | `read`, `write`, `sudo` | `admin-policy`   |
| **Freshers**   | `secret/data/training` | `read`, `list`          | `fresher-policy` |

---

## ✅ Summary

* **Policies** define **who can do what and where** in Vault.
* Use them to enforce strict access control based on teams, roles, or environments.
* You can create as many policies as needed and attach them to different auth methods or tokens.

---

Here are the **most useful Vault CLI commands for working with policies** — explained simply and clearly for software professionals. These will help you **create, view, list, and delete policies** in Vault.

---

## 🔧 1. **Create or Update a Policy**

```bash
vault policy write <policy-name> <file.hcl>
```

**Example:**

```bash
vault policy write dev-policy dev-policy.hcl
```

📝 This creates (or updates) a policy named `dev-policy` using the file `dev-policy.hcl`.

---

## 📖 2. **View a Policy**

```bash
vault policy read <policy-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
vault policy read dev-policy
```

👀 Shows the contents (rules) of the policy in the terminal.

---

## 📋 3. **List All Policies**

```bash
vault policy list
```

📚 Lists all policy names currently stored in Vault (including `root` by default).

---

## ❌ 4. **Delete a Policy**

```bash
vault policy delete <policy-name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
vault policy delete dev-policy
```

🧹 Deletes the policy — useful when you want to remove access or cleanup.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Check If a Policy is Applied to a Token (Debugging)

After login, check your active policies:

```bash
vault token lookup
```

This shows:

* `policies` (e.g. `"dev-policy"`)
* `ttl`, `creation_time`, etc.

---

## ✨ Summary Table

| Action        | Command Example                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Create/Update | `vault policy write dev-policy dev-policy.hcl` |
| View          | `vault policy read dev-policy`                 |
| List All      | `vault policy list`                            |
| Delete        | `vault policy delete dev-policy`               |
| Token Info    | `vault token lookup`                           |

---

Absolutely! Let’s break down **Vault tokens** in a way that’s **easy to understand for software engineers** — whether you're writing Terraform, using Jenkins, or managing cloud infrastructure.

---

## 🔐 What Is a Vault Token?

A **Vault token** is like a **temporary ID card** or **access pass** that allows you (or your application) to interact with Vault securely.

Vault uses **tokens** to identify:

* Who you are
* What you’re allowed to do (based on policies)
* For how long you can access Vault

---

## 🧠 Think of It Like This:

| In Real Life                | In Vault                       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| ID badge at a company       | Vault token                    |
| Badge gives permissions     | Token has attached policies    |
| Badge expires or is revoked | Token has TTL / can be revoked |

---

## 🧩 How Tokens Work in Vault

### 🔹 1. **Created Automatically After Login**

When you log in using:

* AppRole
* GitHub
* Username/Password
* AWS IAM

👉 Vault returns a token.

### 🔹 2. **Used in Environment Variables or API Calls**

You use this token to **authenticate** future Vault requests:

```bash
export VAULT_TOKEN=s.xxxxxx
vault secrets list
```

---

## 🔐 Token Structure (looks like this):

```bash
s.1LqzAqzi9xbYPGYI1GUaQ4Qe
```

* Begins with `s.` (s = service token)
* Randomized string

---

## ✅ Types of Tokens

| Type            | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Root Token**  | Full access (created at Vault init)                    |
| **User Token**  | Created after login (GitHub/AppRole)                   |
| **Batch Token** | Lightweight, used in automation (read-only or limited) |

---

## 🛠 Key Attributes of Tokens

| Attribute   | What It Does                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `policies`  | Controls what the token can access                 |
| `ttl`       | Time to live (how long token is valid)             |
| `renewable` | Can you extend its life (`vault token renew`)      |
| `orphan`    | Does it inherit from a parent token (default = no) |

---

## 📦 Useful Token Commands

| Task                      | Command Example                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Create new token manually | `vault token create -policy="dev-policy"` |
| View current token info   | `vault token lookup`                      |
| Revoke your current token | `vault token revoke`                      |
| Revoke a specific token   | `vault token revoke <token>`              |
| Renew a renewable token   | `vault token renew`                       |

---

## 🔁 Example: Create a Token with TTL

```bash
vault token create -policy="dev-policy" -ttl=1h -renewable=true
```

This creates a token valid for 1 hour, with permission defined by `dev-policy`.

---

## 👇 When You Use Tokens in Practice

### ✅ Terraform (via Vault provider)

```hcl
provider "vault" {
  address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
  token   = var.vault_token
}
```

### ✅ Jenkins

```groovy
withEnv(["VAULT_TOKEN=${vaultToken}"]) {
  sh 'vault kv get secret/myapp'
}
```

---

## 🧼 Best Practices

* ❌ Don’t hardcode tokens in scripts or code
* ✅ Store tokens in CI/CD secret stores (like Jenkins credentials)
* ✅ Use **short TTL** for automation tokens (e.g., 1 hour)
* ✅ Use **AppRole/GitHub login** to generate tokens on-demand

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Lookup Token Info

```bash
vault token lookup
```

Outputs:

```json
{
  "id": "s.xxxxxx",
  "policies": ["default", "dev-policy"],
  "ttl": "59m",
  "renewable": true,
  ...
}
```

---

## ✅ Final Summary

| Feature     | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| What is it? | Vault token is your identity + access pass           |
| Where used? | CLI, Terraform, Jenkins, GitHub apps, etc.           |
| How long?   | Depends on TTL; tokens can be short-lived or renewed |
| How secure? | Secure if kept private and used via automation       |

---

You're almost there — just a small correction needed!

Let me break it down clearly:

---

## ✅ Correct `vault kv put` Command Format

If you're using Vault's **KV v2 secret engine**, the syntax is:

```bash
vault kv put -mount=<mount-name> <path> <key>=<value>
```

So in your case:

```bash
vault kv put -mount=secret cfeds password="kkk"
```

> ✅ This will store the key `password="kkk"` at the path `secret/data/cfeds`

---

## 🧠 Explanation

| Part             | Meaning                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `vault kv put`   | Command to write data to the KV store   |
| `-mount=secret`  | Mount point (i.e., which secret engine) |
| `cfeds`          | Path under the mount where secret goes  |
| `password="kkk"` | The key-value pair you're storing       |

---

## 📥 To Read Back the Secret

```bash
vault kv get -mount=secret cfeds
```

You will get something like:

```yaml
Key       Value
---       -----
password  kkk
```

---

## 🧹 To Delete the Secret (soft delete, recoverable)

```bash
vault kv delete -mount=secret cfeds
```

---

## 🗑️ To Destroy It Permanently (non-recoverable)

```bash
vault kv destroy -mount=secret -versions=1 cfeds
```

> `-versions=1` deletes **version 1** of the secret forever.

---

Great! Let's clearly explain both **Auth Methods** and **Policies** in HashiCorp Vault, side by side, with real-world use cases — made easy for software engineers and DevOps professionals.

---

## 🔐 1. **Auth Methods** in Vault

### 🔎 What are Auth Methods?

> **Auth methods** are *how* you or your app **log in to Vault** — like signing in to a system.

---

### ✅ Common Auth Methods in Vault

| Auth Method | Use Case                               | Who Uses It                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `token`     | Default for root/admin/dev users       | Manual login or automation |
| `AppRole`   | Best for **CI/CD, Terraform, Jenkins** | Machines/services          |
| `GitHub`    | Login using GitHub user/team identity  | Developers                 |
| `Userpass`  | Username/password login                | Basic human users          |
| `AWS IAM`   | IAM identity-based access              | AWS EC2, Lambda            |
| `GCP IAM`   | GCP service account identity           | GCP-based apps             |
| `LDAP`      | Login using corporate directory (AD)   | Enterprise users           |
| `JWT/OIDC`  | Auth via JWT or Identity Provider      | OAuth/GitHub/GitLab/Okta   |

---

### 🔧 Enable an Auth Method Example

```bash
vault auth enable approle
```

```bash
vault auth enable github
```

---

## 📋 2. **Policies** in Vault

### 🔎 What are Policies?

> **Policies define what you're allowed to do in Vault** — like read, write, delete, list secrets, etc.

Auth method = **How you login**
Policy = **What you can access after login**

---

### ✅ Sample Policy (HCL)

```hcl
# Allow reading AWS dynamic credentials
path "aws/creds/dev-role" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Allow working with secrets in a dev namespace
path "secret/data/dev/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "update", "read", "delete", "list"]
}
```

Save it as `dev-policy.hcl`, then upload to Vault:

```bash
vault policy write dev-policy dev-policy.hcl
```

---

## 🧩 Example: Combine Auth Method + Policy

Let’s say you want to give Jenkins (via AppRole) permission to access AWS credentials from Vault.

### ✅ Step-by-Step:

1. **Enable AppRole**

```bash
vault auth enable approle
```

2. **Write a Policy**

```hcl
# File: jenkins-policy.hcl
path "aws/creds/dev-role" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
```

```bash
vault policy write jenkins-policy jenkins-policy.hcl
```

3. **Create AppRole and Assign Policy**

```bash
vault write auth/approle/role/jenkins-role \
  token_policies="jenkins-policy" \
  token_ttl=1h
```

4. **Fetch Role ID + Secret ID**

```bash
vault read auth/approle/role/jenkins-role/role-id
vault write -f auth/approle/role/jenkins-role/secret-id
```

5. **Use these in Jenkins to login and get dynamic secrets**

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Concept     | Description                                    | Example                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Auth Method | How you log in to Vault                        | AppRole, GitHub, AWS IAM, token  |
| Policy      | What you’re allowed to do                      | `read` from `aws/creds/dev-role` |
| Together    | Auth Method gives token → policy grants access | AppRole → `jenkins-policy`       |

---

Great question! Here's a **clear hierarchy** showing how **Secret ID**, **Role ID**, **Policy**, and **Auth Method** are connected in **HashiCorp Vault**.

---

## 🔐 Vault Access Hierarchy (Simple Tree View)

```
Auth Method (e.g., AppRole)
│
├── Role (e.g., dev-role)
│   │
│   ├── Role ID (public)
│   ├── Secret ID (private)
│   └── Attached Policies (e.g., dev-policy)
│
└── Login → Returns Token (with policies from role)
```

---

## 🔍 Explanation of Each Layer

| **Component**   | **What It Is**                                         | **Used For**                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Auth Method** | The way you login to Vault (`approle`, `github`, etc.) | Starts the authentication process       |
| **Role**        | A config object under the auth method                  | Groups permissions & controls access    |
| **Role ID**     | Public ID for the role                                 | Passed by Terraform/Jenkins             |
| **Secret ID**   | Private secret like a password                         | Used with Role ID to login securely     |
| **Policies**    | Access rules attached to the role                      | Define what secrets/actions are allowed |
| **Token**       | Issued after login with Role ID + Secret ID            | Used to access Vault with permissions   |

---

## 🧠 Real-World Example: Jenkins Accessing AWS Secrets from Vault

```text
AppRole (auth method)
 └── dev-team (role)
      ├── role_id = "1234-abcd"
      ├── secret_id = "yyyy-zzzz"
      ├── policy = "dev-policy"
             └── allows: read aws/creds/dev-role
```

Then Jenkins logs in using:

```bash
vault write auth/approle/login role_id="1234-abcd" secret_id="yyyy-zzzz"
```

Vault returns a **token** with the **`dev-policy`** attached, so Jenkins can now read AWS secrets.

---

## 🔁 Flow Summary

```text
1. Enable auth method → AppRole
2. Create a role (e.g., jenkins-role)
3. Assign policies to the role
4. Vault generates:
     • Role ID (like username)
     • Secret ID (like password)
5. Jenkins or Terraform uses both to login
6. Vault returns a token
7. Token is used to access secrets based on policy
```

---


### 🔐 **Vault Token Authentication – Easy Software-Level Explanation**

---

## ✅ What is Token Authentication in Vault?

**Token authentication** is the **default and simplest way** to access Vault.

A **token** is like a key or access card 🪪.
When you use it, Vault checks:

* Is this token valid?
* What policies are attached?
* What can it do?

If valid, you’re allowed in!

---

## 💡 When Do You Use Token Authentication?

* After initial Vault setup (`vault operator init`)
* When doing quick testing with Vault CLI
* When automating with **pre-created tokens**
* When Jenkins or Terraform **already has a valid Vault token**

---

## 🔐 How It Works

### 🔁 Basic Flow

```
Vault Token (like: s.abcd1234)
     ↓
Vault checks: Is this token active?
     ↓
Vault checks: What policies are attached?
     ↓
Vault gives access based on policies
```

---

## 🧪 Common Token Commands

### ✅ 1. **Login using a token**

```bash
vault login s.abcd1234
```

or via environment variable:

```bash
export VAULT_TOKEN="s.abcd1234"
vault kv get secret/myapp
```

---

### 🔁 2. **Renew the current token**

If your token is renewable:

```bash
vault token renew
```

---

### 📜 3. **Check your token info**

```bash
vault token lookup
```

Example output:

```
id           s.abcd1234
ttl          1h
policies     [default dev-policy]
renewable    true
```

---

### 🛠️ 4. **Create a new token**

```bash
vault token create -policy="dev-policy" -ttl=1h
```

---

### 🧹 5. **Revoke a token**

```bash
vault token revoke s.abcd1234
```

---

## 🔒 Token Properties

| Property    | Description                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `id`        | The token string (e.g., s.abcd1234)  |
| `policies`  | What access it has                   |
| `ttl`       | How long it's valid                  |
| `renewable` | Can it be extended automatically?    |
| `orphan`    | Is it independent (no parent token)? |

---

## 🔐 Types of Tokens

| Token Type        | Use Case                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Root Token**    | Full access; created at Vault init |
| **User Token**    | From login (e.g., AppRole, GitHub) |
| **Batch Token**   | Lightweight, non-renewable         |
| **Service Token** | For machines like Jenkins          |

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

* ❌ Never hardcode tokens in code
* ✅ Use short TTLs (`-ttl=1h`)
* ✅ Store tokens in secure CI/CD secret stores
* ✅ Prefer **AppRole login** in automation (to generate token dynamically)

---

## 🧠 Summary

| Item         | Description                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token**    | A temporary pass to Vault                           |
| **Login**    | `vault login <token>` or set `VAULT_TOKEN` env var  |
| **Access**   | Controlled via attached policies                    |
| **Security** | Should be kept secret and rotated/renewed as needed |

---

Great question — and very important in real-world Vault usage.

---

## ❌ What Happens If You Forget the Vault **Root Token**?

The **root token** is the **original admin key** used to fully access Vault.
If it's **lost or forgotten**, **you cannot retrieve it** — but **you can regenerate it safely** using Vault’s **unseal keys**.

---

## ✅ Solution: Use `vault operator generate-root`

Vault allows you to generate a **new root token**, but **only if you have unseal keys**.

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step: Regenerate a New Root Token

### 🧾 Step 1: Start the Generation Process

```bash
vault operator generate-root -init
```

This returns:

* A **nonce** (random value for tracking)
* A **One-Time Password (OTP)**

Keep both safe temporarily.

---

### 🔐 Step 2: Collect Unseal Key Shares

Ask each unseal key holder to enter their key one by one:

```bash
vault operator generate-root -nonce=<nonce> -otp=<otp> -key=<unseal-key-1>
vault operator generate-root -nonce=<nonce> -otp=<otp> -key=<unseal-key-2>
...
```

Do this until you reach the threshold (e.g., 3 out of 5 keys).

---

### ✅ Step 3: Get the Encrypted Token

After the threshold is reached, Vault will give you:

```
Encoded Token: <encrypted-string>
```

---

### 🔓 Step 4: Decode the Final Root Token

```bash
vault operator generate-root -decode=<encoded-token> -otp=<otp>
```

✅ This gives you a brand-new **root token**.

---

## 🧠 Requirements to Do This

* Vault must be **unsealed**
* You need the **unseal keys** (minimum threshold)
* The Vault user must have **local access or API access**

---

## 🚫 If You Lose Both Root Token AND All Unseal Keys?

You **cannot recover Vault**.

You’d have to:

* **Wipe Vault’s storage backend** (like etcd, Consul, file)
* **Reinitialize Vault** (destroying all data)
* Start from scratch.

---

## 🧠 Summary

| If Lost...           | Can You Recover? | How?                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Root Token         | Yes              | With unseal keys via `generate-root` |
| ❌ Unseal Keys + Root | No               | Vault must be reinitialized          |

---

Great question — and very important in real-world Vault usage.

---

## ❌ What Happens If You Forget the Vault **Root Token**?

The **root token** is the **original admin key** used to fully access Vault.
If it's **lost or forgotten**, **you cannot retrieve it** — but **you can regenerate it safely** using Vault’s **unseal keys**.

---

## ✅ Solution: Use `vault operator generate-root`

Vault allows you to generate a **new root token**, but **only if you have unseal keys**.

---

### 🔄 Step-by-Step: Regenerate a New Root Token

### 🧾 Step 1: Start the Generation Process

```bash
vault operator generate-root -init
```

This returns:

* A **nonce** (random value for tracking)
* A **One-Time Password (OTP)**

Keep both safe temporarily.

---

### 🔐 Step 2: Collect Unseal Key Shares

Ask each unseal key holder to enter their key one by one:

```bash
vault operator generate-root -nonce=<nonce> -otp=<otp> -key=<unseal-key-1>
vault operator generate-root -nonce=<nonce> -otp=<otp> -key=<unseal-key-2>
...
```

Do this until you reach the threshold (e.g., 3 out of 5 keys).

---

### ✅ Step 3: Get the Encrypted Token

After the threshold is reached, Vault will give you:

```
Encoded Token: <encrypted-string>
```

---

### 🔓 Step 4: Decode the Final Root Token

```bash
vault operator generate-root -decode=<encoded-token> -otp=<otp>
```

✅ This gives you a brand-new **root token**.

---

## 🧠 Requirements to Do This

* Vault must be **unsealed**
* You need the **unseal keys** (minimum threshold)
* The Vault user must have **local access or API access**

---

## 🚫 If You Lose Both Root Token AND All Unseal Keys?

You **cannot recover Vault**.

You’d have to:

* **Wipe Vault’s storage backend** (like etcd, Consul, file)
* **Reinitialize Vault** (destroying all data)
* Start from scratch.

---

## 🧠 Summary

| If Lost...           | Can You Recover? | How?                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ✅ Root Token         | Yes              | With unseal keys via `generate-root` |
| ❌ Unseal Keys + Root | No               | Vault must be reinitialized          |

Yes! Here's a clear and practical explanation of what you need to do in both **GitHub UI** and **Vault** to enable **GitHub Authentication**:

---

## ✅ 1. GitHub UI: Set Up Organization and Team

### 👣 Step-by-Step in GitHub

#### 🔹 A. Create a GitHub Organization (if not done yet)

* Go to: [https://github.com/organizations/new](https://github.com/organizations/new)
* Give it a name (e.g., `my-org-devops`)
* Add your team members

#### 🔹 B. Create a Team inside the Org

* Go to:
  `GitHub → Your Organization → Teams → New Team`
* Name it like `dev-team`, `ops-team`, etc.
* Add GitHub users to that team

#### 🔹 C. Ask users to create **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**:

* Go to: `Settings → Developer settings → Personal Access Tokens → Fine-grained tokens`
* Scopes needed: ✅ `read:org`
* They will use this token to log in to Vault

---

## ✅ 2. Vault CLI: Configure GitHub Authentication

#### 🔹 A. Enable GitHub Auth Method

```bash
vault auth enable github
```

#### 🔹 B. Configure the GitHub Organization

Replace `my-org-devops` with your real GitHub org name:

```bash
vault write auth/github/config organization=my-org-devops
```

#### 🔹 C. Map a GitHub Team to a Vault Policy

Let’s say your GitHub team is `dev-team`:

```bash
vault write auth/github/map/teams/dev-team value=dev-policy
```

✅ Now anyone in `dev-team` who logs in via GitHub will receive `dev-policy` in Vault.

---

## 🧑‍💻 User Login Example

When a user logs in to Vault using their GitHub PAT:

```bash
vault login -method=github token=<GitHub_PAT>
```

> Vault will:
>
> * Check if the token is valid
> * Confirm the user is in the right GitHub team/org
> * Assign the mapped policy (`dev-policy`)
> * Return a Vault token with permissions

---

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Platform | Task                | What to Do                              |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| GitHub   | Create Organization | e.g., `my-org-devops`                   |
| GitHub   | Create Team         | e.g., `dev-team`, add members           |
| GitHub   | PAT for login       | Must include `read:org` permission      |
| Vault    | Enable GitHub auth  | `vault auth enable github`              |
| Vault    | Configure org name  | `vault write auth/github/config...`     |
| Vault    | Map team to policy  | `vault write auth/github/map/teams/...` |

Absolutely! Here's a **combined and simplified guide** for moving from **Vault Dev Mode to Production Mode**, with both **local testing (no TLS)** and **production best practices** included.

---

# 🚀 Full Guide: Transition from Dev Mode to Production Mode in Vault (with Raft Storage)

---

## 🛑 Step 0: **Stop Vault Dev Mode (If Running)**

If you're running Vault like this:

```bash
vault server -dev
```

**Stop it** (to avoid port conflicts):

```bash
# In terminal: Ctrl+C
# Or manually kill:
ps aux | grep vault
kill <vault-dev-pid>
```

---

## ✅ Step 1: **Unset Dev Root Token**

If your shell has a leftover token:

```bash
unset VAULT_TOKEN
```

---

## ✅ Step 2: **Create Storage Directory for Raft**

```bash
mkdir -p ./vault/data
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: **Write Minimal `config.hcl` (for local dev/test)**

You can run Vault in "file-based Raft mode" without TLS for **testing purposes** (not production!).

```hcl
# config.hcl
storage "raft" {
  path    = "./vault/data"
  node_id = "node1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8200"
  tls_disable = "true"
}

api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
cluster_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8201"
ui = true
```

> 🔐 For **real production**, use:
>
> * `/opt/vault/data` instead of `./vault/data`
> * `tls_cert_file` and `tls_key_file` instead of `tls_disable = true`

---

## ✅ Step 4: **Start Vault Server**

```bash
vault server -config=config.hcl
```

Keep this terminal running, or run it as a background/systemd process.

---

## ✅ Step 5: **Export Vault Address**

In a **new terminal**:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
```

---

## ✅ Step 6: **Initialize Vault**

```bash
vault operator init
```

> This gives:
>
> * 5 unseal keys
> * 1 root token

✔️ Save the output to `cluster-keys.txt`.

---

## ✅ Step 7: **Unseal Vault**

Use any **3 of the 5 keys**:

```bash
vault operator unseal <key1>
vault operator unseal <key2>
vault operator unseal <key3>
```

Vault becomes **unsealed and active**.

---

## ✅ Step 8: **Enable Auth Methods and Policies**

```bash
vault auth enable approle
vault policy write dev-policy dev-policy.hcl
vault write auth/approle/role/dev token_policies="dev-policy"
```

---

## ✅ Step 9: **Enable Audit Logging (optional but recommended)**

```bash
vault audit enable file file_path=/var/log/vault_audit.log
```

---

## ✅ Step 10: **\[For Real Production] Update for TLS + Auto-Unseal**

Update `vault.hcl` like this:

```hcl
storage "raft" {
  path    = "/opt/vault/data"
  node_id = "vault-1"
}

listener "tcp" {
  address       = "0.0.0.0:8200"
  tls_cert_file = "/etc/vault.d/vault.crt"
  tls_key_file  = "/etc/vault.d/vault.key"
}

seal "awskms" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
  kms_key_id = "your-kms-key-id"
}

api_addr = "https://<vault-node-ip>:8200"
cluster_addr = "https://<vault-node-ip>:8201"
ui = true
```

Then:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable vault
sudo systemctl start vault
```

Great question!

Let me explain **why Vault uses unseal keys**, and how it works — in simple, DevOps-friendly language.

---

## 🔐 Why Does Vault Need Unseal Keys?

### 👉 To **protect your secrets**, even if someone steals the storage files.

When Vault is started, its data is **encrypted at rest** (on disk).
To use it, you must **decrypt** that data — this process is called **"unsealing"**.

---

## 🔑 What Are Unseal Keys?

When you first **initialize Vault**, it generates:

* **A Master Key** (used to decrypt the actual data encryption key)
* But instead of giving you the full master key directly, it **splits it into parts** (using [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing))

You get:

* `key-shares = 5` → 5 unseal keys
* `key-threshold = 3` → Need any 3 of them to unseal Vault

So:

```bash
vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3
```

You will see:

```bash
Unseal Key 1: sdsd-123...
Unseal Key 2: sdfg-456...
Unseal Key 3: jkkk-789...
Unseal Key 4: ...
Unseal Key 5: ...
Initial Root Token: s.abcd1234
```

---

## 🔄 Why the Split?

To **prevent a single person** from having full control of Vault.

* It forces **multiple trusted people** to work together to start Vault
* Adds **security and accountability**

---

## 🔓 What Is Unsealing?

Unsealing = Reconstructing the master key from key parts, so Vault can decrypt the **actual encryption key** used to access secrets.

You run:

```bash
vault operator unseal <key1>
vault operator unseal <key2>
vault operator unseal <key3>
```

✔️ After threshold is met → Vault is unsealed and ready to serve requests

---

## 🚀 Auto-Unseal (Production Feature)

In production, you can **avoid manual unsealing** by using:

| Cloud Provider | Method           |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| AWS            | AWS KMS          |
| GCP            | Google Cloud KMS |
| Azure          | Azure Key Vault  |

This allows Vault to **auto-unseal** itself securely at boot.

Example in `vault.hcl`:

```hcl
seal "awskms" {
  region = "us-east-1"
  kms_key_id = "your-kms-key-id"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Summary

| Concept         | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unseal Keys** | Parts of the master key (sharded)                 |
| **Threshold**   | Minimum number of keys to unseal Vault            |
| **Purpose**     | Security: No single person can access all secrets |
| **Auto-Unseal** | Automatically unseals using cloud KMS             |
