Here’s the written version of the content from your screenshot in **simple and clear language**:

## 🛠️ What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an **open-source** and **cloud-agnostic** tool for managing **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

* **Open-source** → Free to use and customizable.
* **Cloud-agnostic** → Works with all major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.).

---

### 📄 How Terraform works:

Terraform uses **declarative configuration files**, meaning:

> "You define *what* you want, and Terraform figures out *how* to make it happen."

These configuration files are written in:

> 🟨 **HCL** — *HashiCorp Configuration Language*

---

### 🔤 Example Terraform Code:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "iac_in_action" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  availability_zone = var.availability_zone

  key_name = aws_key_pair.iac_in_action.key_name
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.iac_in_action.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform-managed EC2 Instance for IaC in Action"
  }
}
```

---

### 💡 Notes:

* `resource` block → Creates a new AWS EC2 instance.
* Uses variables (`var.ami_id`, etc.) for reusability.
* Tags and security group info are declared directly in code.
* No manual steps needed — just run `terraform apply` and Terraform provisions everything!
