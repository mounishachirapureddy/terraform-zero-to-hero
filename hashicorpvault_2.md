## 🔐 HashiCorp Vault - Enable Path + Read/Write/Delete Operations (Step-by-Step)

---

### 🧠 What is a "Secrets Engine"?

A **secrets engine** in Vault is like a plugin that lets you store and manage secrets.

For example:

* `kv` → key-value secrets (most common)
* `aws` → generate AWS access keys
* `database` → manage DB credentials

---

## ✅ Step 1: Enable the KV Secrets Engine Path

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=mysecrets kv
```

### 🔍 What this does:

* Creates a new secrets path: `mysecrets/`
* You can now store secrets under this path like:
  `mysecrets/app`, `mysecrets/db`, etc.

> 📌 In **dev mode**, the default `secret/` path is already enabled — no need to do this step.

---

## ✍️ Step 2: Write a Secret

```bash
vault kv put mysecrets/app username=admin password=12345
```

### 💡 What it does:

* Creates or updates a secret at: `mysecrets/app`
* Stores two key-value pairs:

  * `username = admin`
  * `password = 12345`

---

## 📖 Step 3: Read a Secret

```bash
vault kv get mysecrets/app
```

### 🔍 Output example:

```
====== Metadata ======
Key              Value
---              -----
created_time     2025-07-01T09:00:00Z
version          1

====== Data ======
Key         Value
---         -----
username    admin
password    12345
```

---

## 🗑️ Step 4: Soft Delete the Secret

```bash
vault kv delete mysecrets/app
```

### 🔍 What it does:

* Marks the latest version of the secret as **deleted**
* It is **not permanently removed** — can be restored

---

## 💣 Step 5: Destroy a Secret (Permanent Delete)

```bash
vault kv destroy -versions=1 mysecrets/app
```

### 🔍 What it does:

* **Permanently deletes** version 1 of the secret
* Cannot be recovered

> 🔥 Use this only if you're sure you want to erase it forever

---

## 📁 Step 6: List All Secrets in a Path

```bash
vault kv list mysecrets/
```

### 🔍 What it does:

* Lists all keys/secrets stored under `mysecrets/`

Example output:

```
Keys
----
app
db
```

---

Let me know if you want the same steps for:

* Using the **default `secret/` path**
* Working with **non-versioned** (KV v1)
* Creating **access policies**
* Or using these via the **Vault UI or API**
---
Great question! Yes, when you **soft delete** a secret in **Vault KV version 2**, it just marks the version as **deleted**, but not destroyed. You can **recover (undelete)** it anytime until it's permanently destroyed.

Here’s how to **recover (undelete) a deleted secret**, in **very simple steps** with examples:

---

## 🔄 How to Recover a Deleted Secret in Vault (KV Version 2)

---

### 🗑️ When You Delete:

```bash
vault kv delete mysecrets/app
```

This does **not destroy the data**. It just **hides** the latest version.

You can **undelete it** using the `vault kv undelete` command.

---

## ♻️ Step to Recover (Undelete) Secret

### ✅ Command:

```bash
vault kv undelete -versions=1 mysecrets/app
```

### 🔍 What it means:

* `-versions=1` → The version number you want to recover
* `mysecrets/app` → Path of the secret

> 📌 You can also recover multiple versions:

```bash
vault kv undelete -versions=1,2 mysecrets/app
```

---

### 🔎 How to Know Which Versions Were Deleted?

Run:

```bash
vault kv metadata get mysecrets/app
```

It shows metadata like:

* Current version
* Deleted versions
* Destroyed versions

Example output:

```
Version    Created Time            Deletion Time       Destroyed
--------   -------------------     -----------------   ----------
1          2025-07-01T09:00:00Z    2025-07-01T10:00Z   false
```

This means version 1 is deleted (but can be recovered).

---

## 🚫 Note:

* You can **undelete** only if the version is **not destroyed**.
* Once you run `vault kv destroy`, recovery is **not possible**.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Action        | Command Example                               | Purpose                 |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Delete Secret | `vault kv delete mysecrets/app`               | Marks secret as deleted |
| Undelete      | `vault kv undelete -versions=1 mysecrets/app` | Restores soft-deleted   |
| Check Status  | `vault kv metadata get mysecrets/app`         | See deleted versions    |

Here’s a **very easy explanation** of **Secret Engines in HashiCorp Vault**, in clear **Markdown format**, perfect for quick learning or documentation:

---

## 🔐 What Are Secret Engines in Vault?

Secret engines are **pluggable modules** in Vault that **store**, **generate**, or **manage** secrets.

Think of them like apps inside Vault that each serve a special purpose.

---

## 🧰 Types of Secret Engines

### 🔑 1. **KV (Key-Value)**

* Store static secrets like API keys, passwords
* Most common engine
* Example:

  ```bash
  vault kv put secret/myapp password=12345
  ```

---

### ☁️ 2. **AWS, Azure, GCP**

* **Dynamically generate cloud credentials**
* Vault talks to cloud providers on demand
* Example:

  * Generate temporary AWS access keys for users

---

### 🛢️ 3. **Database**

* Vault generates **DB usernames/passwords** with TTL
* Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle, etc.
* Example:

  * App gets DB creds that expire in 1 hour

---

### 🔐 4. **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**

* Generates SSL/TLS certificates
* Acts like your own certificate authority (CA)

---

### 🧑‍💼 5. **Identity**

* Manages users and groups inside Vault
* Used for fine-grained access control

---

### 🧰 6. **Transit**

* Doesn’t store data — **encrypts/decrypts** data on the fly
* Useful for apps that need encryption without storing keys

---

## 🧪 How to Enable a Secret Engine

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=mysecrets kv
```

You can enable any engine at a custom path.

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Secret Engine | Purpose                         | Example Use Case                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `kv`          | Store static secrets            | API keys, passwords              |
| `aws`         | Dynamic cloud credentials       | Temporary AWS IAM users          |
| `database`    | Dynamic DB credentials          | Temporary MySQL/PostgreSQL users |
| `pki`         | SSL/TLS certificate generation  | Internal services certificates   |
| `transit`     | Encrypt/decrypt without storage | Secure app data                  |
| `identity`    | Manage users/groups             | Role-based access                |

---

Absolutely! Here's a **very easy explanation** of **Dynamic Secrets for AWS in HashiCorp Vault**, just like the one we did for databases — step-by-step, beginner-friendly, and in clean **Markdown format**:

---

## ☁️ Dynamic AWS Secrets in HashiCorp Vault (Easy Guide)

---

### 🧠 What Are AWS Dynamic Secrets?

Vault can **create temporary AWS access keys** on the fly when requested.

These are:

* Valid for a short time (`TTL`)
* Automatically **revoked/expired**
* **Safer** than storing long-term AWS keys

---

## 🏗️ Step-by-Step: Enable and Use AWS Dynamic Secrets

---

### ✅ Step 1: Enable AWS Secrets Engine

```bash
vault secrets enable -path=aws aws
```

* `-path=aws` lets you use the engine at `aws/`
* You can change the path (e.g., `aws-prod/`) if needed

---

### 🔧 Step 2: Configure AWS Access (using root/admin user)

```bash
vault write aws/config/root \
  access_key=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \
  secret_key=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \
  region=us-east-1
```

> 📌 Use an IAM user with permissions to create/manage IAM users/roles.

---

### 👥 Step 3: Create a Vault Role to Define AWS Permissions

```bash
vault write aws/roles/dev-role \
  credential_type=iam_user \
  policy_document=-<<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

* `dev-role` is the name of this dynamic role
* Vault will use this policy to create IAM users with these permissions

---

### 🔑 Step 4: Generate Dynamic AWS Credentials

```bash
vault read aws/creds/dev-role
```

### 🧾 Sample Output:

```
Key             Value
---             -----
lease_id        aws/creds/dev-role/some-id
access_key      AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
secret_key      wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
lease_duration  768h
```

> 🔐 These credentials are **real IAM user keys** with limited permissions and TTL.

---

### 🧹 Step 5: Revoke Early (Optional)

```bash
vault lease revoke aws/creds/dev-role/some-id
```

> 💣 This will immediately delete the temporary IAM user Vault created.

---

## 📌 Summary Table

| Step        | Command Example                      | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Enable      | `vault secrets enable -path=aws aws` | Activate AWS engine          |
| Configure   | `vault write aws/config/root ...`    | Connect Vault to AWS         |
| Create Role | `vault write aws/roles/dev-role ...` | Define AWS access policy     |
| Get Creds   | `vault read aws/creds/dev-role`      | Get temporary AWS keys       |
| Revoke      | `vault lease revoke <lease_id>`      | Manually expire the IAM user |

---

## 🔐 Why Use This?

✅ No hardcoded AWS keys in your code
✅ Auto-expiring access = safer cloud
✅ Least-privilege access by default
✅ Easy to rotate or revoke anytime

---

Sure! Let's explain **how Vault gives AWS keys (dynamic secrets)** in a way a **6th class student** will understand:

---

## ☁️ Imagine This: Vault is a Magical Key-Maker 🔑✨

### 🏫 Story Time!

### 👦 You are the student.

### 🧑‍🏫 Vault is your teacher.

### 🏰 AWS is the library.

But… the library is **locked**, and you need **a special key** to go in.

---

### 💡 Normally:

* The teacher gives you **one big master key** forever. 😟
  But if you lose it, someone can sneak into the library!

---

### 🔐 With Vault:

* The teacher makes a **brand-new key** just for you 🔑
* The key **opens only one room** (like S3 or EC2)
* It **vanishes after some time** (like 1 hour) ⏰
* If you return early, the key is **destroyed immediately** 🧹

---

## 💬 What You Do:

You ask your teacher (Vault):

> “Can I please have a key to see EC2 and S3?”

Vault checks:

* Are you allowed?
* What kind of key do you need?

Then says:

> “Here’s a key just for you! 🔑 Use it for 1 hour only!”

---

## 🤖 Behind the Scenes (Technical Version)

1. Vault is **connected** to AWS using an admin key.
2. When you ask for a key, Vault:

   * Tells AWS: “Make a user just for this student.”
   * Gives you that user’s **access key and secret key**.
3. You use those to do things like list EC2 or S3.
4. After 1 hour, Vault tells AWS: “Delete that user.”

---

## 🔁 Why This is Awesome?

* You don’t keep any secret forever!
* If someone steals your key, it’ll stop working soon.
* Vault logs everything so your teacher knows who got what.

---

Perfect! Let's explain **"roles" in HashiCorp Vault** like you're a **6th class student** — super easy and fun! 😊

---

## 🎭 What Are "Roles" in Vault?

### 👦 You = Student

### 🧑‍🏫 Vault = Teacher

### 🏫 Roles = ID Cards for Students

---

### 📚 Imagine This:

You go to a school library (Vault).
There are many students — but not everyone is allowed to do the same things.

* Some can only **read books** 📖
* Some can **write on the board** 🖊️
* Some can even **lock the library** 🔒

So the **teacher gives different ID cards (roles)** based on what each student is allowed to do.

---

### 🗝️ In Vault:

A **role** is like a **permission ticket**.

Vault uses roles to:

* Decide **what you’re allowed to do**
* Decide **what kind of secret** you get (like AWS key, DB password)
* Set **time limits** (like: “this key will work for 1 hour”)

---

### 🔧 Example:

You tell Vault:

> “Hey, I want an AWS key.”

Vault checks:

> “Which **role** are you asking for?”

You say:

> “I need the **dev-role**.”

Vault says:

> “Okay! That role is only allowed to list S3 buckets and EC2 machines. Here’s your key. It’ll expire in 1 hour.”

---

## ✅ Real Command Example

```bash
vault write aws/roles/dev-role \
  credential_type=iam_user \
  policy_document=... \
  default_ttl=1h
```

* `dev-role` is like the **student’s ID card**
* It tells Vault what secrets to give and how long they last

---

## 🧠 Why Roles Are Important

| Like in School       | In Vault                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Class monitor        | Role with full admin access |
| Library-only student | Role with read-only access  |
| Visitor badge        | Role with short time limit  |

Roles keep things **organized**, **secure**, and **fair**.
