### ❓ What is `terraform.lock.hcl`?

It is a file **automatically created by Terraform** when you run:

```
terraform init
```

---

### ✅ Why is it created?

To **lock the provider versions** (like AWS, GCP, etc.) so that:

* You and your team all use the **same versions**.
* Terraform doesn’t suddenly **use a new version** that might break your setup.

---

### 📦 Example

Let’s say your code needs the AWS provider.

If you don’t lock it:

* One person might use version 5.0
* Another might use version 4.0
* That can cause **errors or different behavior**

With `terraform.lock.hcl`:

* Everyone uses the **same version** (example: 5.29.0)
* No surprises!

### 🔄 **When do you need to update the `terraform.lock.hcl` version?**

You update it **when you want to use a newer version** of a provider (like AWS, GCP, etc.).

---

### ✅ **Steps to update provider version**

1. **Change the provider version** in `versions.tf` or `main.tf` (whichever has the `required_providers` block).

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       aws = {
         source  = "hashicorp/aws"
         version = ">= 5.30.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Run this command to upgrade and update the lock file**:

   ```
   terraform init -upgrade
   ```

   ✅ This will:

   * Download the new version
   * Update `terraform.lock.hcl` with the new version and hashes

---

### 💡 Simple Example:

Let’s say `terraform.lock.hcl` is using AWS provider `5.29.0`, but you want to move to `5.30.0`.

You do:

```sh
terraform init -upgrade
```

And now the lock file will store `5.30.0`.
