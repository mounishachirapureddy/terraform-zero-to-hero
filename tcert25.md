## 🌐 **Policy as Code (using Sentinel in Terraform)**

**Sentinel is built around the idea of policy-as-code**, which means **writing policies in code** format instead of manually enforcing rules.

---

### ✅ **Benefits of Policy as Code (Top Section):**

| Feature                | Simple Meaning                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔒 **Sandboxing**      | Adds safety limits (like a protective barrier) to avoid risky actions — like preventing deletion of important resources. |
| 📜 **Codification**    | Your policies are clear, well-written, and act exactly as written — no confusion.                                        |
| 🕒 **Version Control** | Like Git. You can track all policy changes over time, and go back if something breaks.                                   |
| 🧪 **Testing**         | Sentinel lets you **test** if your policies behave properly before you apply them.                                       |
| ⚙️ **Automation**      | Policies can be **auto-executed** — like sending alerts or blocking unsafe infra automatically.                          |

### ✅ **Sentinel and Policy as Code (Bottom Section):**

| Topic                  | Explanation                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 **Language**        | All policies use the **Sentinel language** — simple, readable, made for both devs and non-devs. |
| 👨‍💻 **Development**  | You get a CLI (command line tool) to write and test policies.                                   |
| 🧪 **Testing** (again) | There’s a built-in **test framework** to test before applying — to prevent surprise failures.   |

---

### ✅ Summary of Key Benefits:

* Stops mistakes before they happen
* Makes policy predictable and testable
* Easy rollback (Git-like)
* Works across cloud providers

---

Would you like a **real-world example of a Sentinel policy** (like: “Don't allow EC2 without tags” or “Enforce region = us-east-1”)?
Yes, this screenshot is perfectly readable, and I’ll explain **everything shown** in a **simple and clear** way:

---

## ✅ **Sentinel Policy Language Example**

This page gives examples of **policies you can write and enforce** using Sentinel for various cloud providers.

---

### ☁️ **AWS Examples**

These policies protect and control AWS resources:

* **Restrict owners** of the `aws_ami` data source (control who can use specific AMIs).
* **Enforce tags** (like `Environment=Prod`) on all AWS resources — important for billing and tracking.
* **Restrict AZs** (Availability Zones) used by EC2 — helps reduce cost or control usage.
* **Disallow 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR** in security groups — blocks open-to-world access.
* **Restrict instance types** — like no GPU machines unless required.
* **Make S3 buckets private** and encrypted with **KMS** keys — improves security.
* **Enable DNS hostnames** in VPCs — necessary for EC2 naming and private DNS.

---

### ☁️ **Google Cloud Platform**

Similar control, but for GCP:

* Force **mandatory labels** on VMs.
* Block **0.0.0.0/0** in firewall rules.
* **Limit GKE clusters** (Kubernetes engine).
* Restrict **machine types** for cost or policy reasons.

---

### ☁️ **VMWare**

Sentinel can even enforce policies on VMWare infrastructure:

* Control **Storage DRS** (automated load balancing).
* Restrict virtual **disk size and type**.
* Restrict **CPU/memory** of VMs.
* Control **NFS** and **Kerberos** access.

---

### ☁️ **Azure**

Policies for Microsoft Azure:

* **Mandatory tags** on all VMs.
* Control which **VM publishers** can be used (e.g., allow only Microsoft images).
* Restrict **VM image selection**.
* Limit **VM size** to control cost.
* Restrict **AKS clusters** and **CIDR blocks** in NSGs.

---

### ☁️ **Cloud-Agnostic Policies**

These work **in any cloud or platform**:

* Only allow **approved providers** (e.g., no random community providers).
* Limit **proposed monthly costs**.
* Stop provider usage **outside root module**.
* Force modules to have **version constraints**.
* Require use of **private module registry**.
* Enforce use of **latest module versions**.

---

### ✅ Summary:

Sentinel gives you **full control** to:

* Enforce security ✅
* Control cost 💰
* Block dangerous settings 🛡
* Force consistency across teams 👥

---

Would you like me to write a **sample Sentinel policy** for any of these examples (like AWS S3 bucket privacy or tag enforcement)?
Yes! Let's break down the **Sentinel Policy Language Example** shown in your screenshot, which **restricts the Availability Zones (AZs) used for EC2 instances** on AWS.

---

### 📘 **What this Sentinel policy does:**

It enforces that EC2 instances can only be deployed in **specific allowed Availability Zones** like `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, etc.

---

### 🔍 Code Breakdown (Step-by-Step):

#### ✅ **1. Import Policy Language Functions**

```hcl
import "tfplan-functions" as plan
```

* Loads the `tfplan-functions` module to read and filter Terraform plans.
* `plan` becomes the alias used to access its functions.

---

#### ✅ **2. Specify Allowed AZs**

```hcl
allowed_zones = [
  "us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c",
  "us-east-1d", "us-east-1e", "us-east-1f"
]
```

* These are the **only Availability Zones** where EC2s are allowed to launch.
* You can modify this list to suit your compliance/security policy.

---

#### ✅ **3. Get All EC2 Instances from the Plan**

```hcl
allEC2Instances = plan.find_resources("aws_instance")
```

* Searches the Terraform plan for **all `aws_instance` resources**.
* This is how Sentinel inspects planned infrastructure changes.

---

#### ✅ **4. Filter for Violations**

```hcl
violatingEC2Instances = plan.filter_attribute_not_in_list(
  allEC2Instances,
  "availability_zone",
  allowed_zones,
  true
)
```

* **Finds EC2 instances** that are using AZs **not in** the allowed list.
* The `true` at the end means: treat **missing values as violations**.
* The result is a list of EC2s that break the policy.

---

#### ✅ **5. Define the Main Rule**

```hcl
main = rule {
  length(violatingEC2Instances["messages"]) is 0
}
```

* This is the final **enforcement rule**.
* ✅ The policy **passes** if there are **no violations**.
* ❌ If `messages` has any entries (i.e., bad EC2s), the policy fails.

---

### 📌 Summary:

| Step                             | What It Does                                   |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `import "tfplan-functions"`      | Lets you analyze Terraform plans               |
| `allowed_zones`                  | Defines compliant Availability Zones           |
| `find_resources()`               | Finds all EC2s in the Terraform plan           |
| `filter_attribute_not_in_list()` | Filters EC2s that violate allowed AZs          |
| `rule`                           | Fails the plan if any EC2 uses a disallowed AZ |

---

### ✅ Use Case:

This is ideal for organizations that:

* Want to restrict deployments to certain AZs (e.g., for cost, latency, or region-specific policies).
* Use **Sentinel in Terraform Cloud/Enterprise** to enforce compliance.

Would you like me to **customize** this policy for:

* A different resource (like S3 or RDS)?
* A different kind of restriction (like instance type or tags)?
Great! This screenshot explains **how Sentinel integrates with Terraform Cloud**, forming a crucial part of your **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) pipeline** to enforce governance and compliance.

### 🔐 **Sentinel with Terraform — Integration Overview**

#### 🚀 **How it Works:**

1. **SCM (Source Control Management)**
   Your Terraform configuration code lives in GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.

2. **Terraform Cloud**
   This is where your Terraform code runs—plans, applies, state management.

3. **Plan Phase**
   When a `terraform plan` is executed in Terraform Cloud, it generates a **plan file** containing all proposed infrastructure changes.

4. **Sentinel Policies**
   These policies are automatically applied to the plan file.
   ➤ Example: “Only allow t2.micro EC2s” or “Disallow public S3 buckets.”

5. **Apply Phase**
   If the policy check passes, `terraform apply` proceeds to create the resources.

6. **New Infrastructure**
   Approved resources are created — only if they comply with Sentinel rules.

---

### 🛡️ **What is a Policy Set in Terraform Cloud?**

* A **Policy Set** is a **group of Sentinel policies**.
* You create a Policy Set **once** and **reuse** it across multiple workspaces.
* It allows centralized management of compliance logic.

#### 📍 How to Connect a Policy Set:

1. **Go to Terraform Cloud UI**
2. **Navigate to Policies > Create Policy Set**
3. **Choose Source (VCS)** where Sentinel policies are stored.
4. **Select Repositories/Workspaces** where this policy set should apply.

### 🧠 Why It’s Powerful:

| Feature                 | Benefit                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Automatic Checks      | No need to remember rules—policies enforce them every run.           |
| 🔁 Reusable Policy Sets | Apply consistent security & compliance across many workspaces.       |
| 📦 VCS Integration      | Manage policy versions like code — version-controlled and auditable. |
| 🔐 Preventive Security  | Blocks harmful infra before it ever reaches your cloud provider.     |
