Great! Let's break down this screenshot on **HashiCorp Packer** into very simple, clear terms.

---

### 🌟 What is Packer?

**Packer** is a **tool to create machine images** — think of them as **pre-installed VMs** (like Amazon AMIs or Azure Images) that are ready to go with all software pre-installed.

You use Packer **before deployment** so that:

* You **build once** (like a golden image)
* Then you **deploy that image repeatedly** across environments (prod, dev, test, etc.)

---

### 🔧 What Does "Provision a Build Image" Mean?

It means:

> "Create a virtual machine image that already has all the tools, configs, and apps inside — ready for deployment."

Example:

* Ubuntu + NGINX + Python pre-installed
* You don’t have to re-install them again on every VM

---

### ✅ Why Use Packer?

As the screenshot shows, using pre-built images gives you:

* **Immutable infrastructure** (unchangeable, consistent machines)
* **One-to-one configuration** (all machines are exact clones)
* **Faster deployment** (skip setup time)
* **Detect issues early** (build failures happen before deployment)

---

### 🔄 Image Pipeline (Bottom Diagram)

This shows a typical workflow:

| Step                                  | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commit Changes (Git)**              | You update some app/config and push code                    |
| **CI/CD**                             | CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered     |
| **Trigger Build Image (Packer)**      | Packer builds a new machine image with latest updates       |
| **Provision Image (Ansible)**         | Optional step: install/configure apps (like NGINX)          |
| **Store Image**                       | The built image is saved (e.g., AWS AMI, Azure image, etc.) |
| **Reference Image (Terraform)**       | Terraform refers to this image in its EC2/VM definitions    |
| **Provision Infra (Terraform → AWS)** | Terraform launches real machines using this built image     |

---

### 🧠 Summary

* **Packer** builds the machine image (baked with software)
* **Terraform** uses that image to launch infrastructure
* Together, they make deployment **faster**, **repeatable**, and **more secure**

---

Would you like a real-world **Packer example + Terraform to launch EC2**? I can show you.
Yes ✅ — **in real-time production environments**, this exact pattern of using **Packer + Terraform** is **widely used** in the DevOps and cloud industry. Let me explain why, how, and when it’s used in real-world scenarios:

---

## ✅ Why You *Should* Use Packer + Terraform in Real-Time:

| 🔧 Component  | 📌 Role in Production                                                              | 💼 Real-world Value                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Packer**    | Builds pre-configured machine images (e.g., with apps like NGINX, Docker, Node.js) | ✅ Ensures consistency and faster boot times              |
| **Terraform** | Provisions infrastructure (e.g., EC2, VPC, Load Balancer) using code               | ✅ Enables automation, repeatability, and version control |
| **Combo**     | Uses Packer's AMI inside Terraform resource                                        | ✅ Fast, clean, predictable deployments of servers        |

---

## 🏢 Real-World Example Use Cases

| Scenario                     | How Packer + Terraform Helps                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-Scaling**             | AMIs created by Packer are used in Auto Scaling groups to boot new instances with exact config     |
| **Golden Images**            | Security-compliant base AMIs (with antivirus, CIS benchmark configs, etc.)                         |
| **Zero Downtime Deployment** | Use AMI versioning + Terraform `blue-green` strategies                                             |
| **Immutable Infrastructure** | Avoid changing existing servers; instead, build new AMI and redeploy — this is a **best practice** |

---

## 🧠 What Companies Actually Do (Best Practice Flow)

```text
[CI/CD Tool like Jenkins or GitHub Actions]
            ↓

If you're working in **AWS + Terraform** setup in a **DevOps job**, this is **standard** practice.

Would you like help setting up **a full pipeline using Packer + Terraform + Jenkins or GitHub Actions**?
This screenshot explains a **Packer Template File**, which is used to create a custom AMI (Amazon Machine Image) in AWS. Let's break it down simply using the exact content from the image:

---

## 🧾 What is a Packer Template?

* A **Packer Template** is a configuration file written in **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**.
* It tells Packer:

  * ✅ **What image to use**
  * ✅ **How to configure it**
  * ✅ **What scripts to run**
  * ✅ **Where to store the final image**

---

## 📦 Packer Template Breakdown (from image)

### 1. **Variables Block**

```hcl
variable "ami_id" {
  type    = string
  default = "ami-01e78c5619c5e68b4"
}
```

* Declares a variable to hold the base AMI ID.

---

### 2. **Locals Block**

```hcl
locals {
  app_name = "httpd"
}
```

* A local variable storing the app name (`httpd` = Apache HTTP server).

---

### 3. **Source Block**

```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "httpd" {
  ami_name      = "my-server-${local.app_name}"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  region        = "us-west-2"
  source_ami    = "${var.ami_id}"
  ssh_username  = "ec2-user"
  tags = {
    Env  = "DEMO"
    Name = "my-server-${local.app_name}"
  }
}
```

* 🔸 `amazon-ebs`: tells Packer to build an **EBS-backed AMI** for AWS.
* 🔸 It uses:

  * `t2.micro` EC2 type
  * AMI ID given in variable
  * SSH username
  * Region: `us-west-2`
  * Adds tags like `Env=DEMO` for identification

---

### 4. **Build Block**

```hcl
build {
  sources = ["source.amazon-ebs.httpd"]

  provisioner "shell" {
    script = "script/script.sh"
  }

  post-processor "shell-local" {
    inline = ["echo foo"]
  }
}
```

#### 🔹 What Happens in the Build:

* Packer uses the **source** block created above.
* Runs a **shell script (`script.sh`)** on the instance (installs packages, configs, etc).
* Finally, a **post-processor** (local shell command) runs after the AMI is created.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept          | Meaning                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `source`         | Where and what AMI to build        |
| `build`          | How to configure the AMI           |
| `provisioner`    | Installs or configures software    |
| `post-processor` | Runs commands after image creation |

---

## 🏁 Result of This Template

You get a **custom AMI**:

* Based on an existing AMI
* With your custom app or config (`httpd`, etc.)
* Ready to use in **Terraform for provisioning EC2 instances**

---

Let me know if you want a **complete working Packer + Terraform demo**!
Here’s a simple explanation of the content shown in your screenshot about **Terraform and Consul**:

---

### ✅ What is **Consul**?

**Consul** is a **service networking platform** that helps services (like microservices or containers) **talk to each other** in a safe and reliable way. Think of it as a smart address book + traffic controller + configuration center.

---

### 🧠 What Consul Does (Explained Simply):

#### 1. **Service Discovery**

* It acts like a **central registry**.
* All services register themselves here.
* When one service wants to call another, it **asks Consul** for the correct address.
* This avoids using hardcoded IPs or DNS names.

> 🟡 Example: Service A wants to talk to Service B → It queries Consul for B’s current IP/port.

#### 2. **Service Mesh**

* Think of this as **smart traffic control** between services.
* It adds a **communication layer** on top of your app.
* Helps manage load balancing, encryption (TLS), retries, etc.

> 🔁 It works like middleware that securely routes and manages traffic.

#### 3. **Application Configuration**

* Consul has a **Key-Value Store** that acts like a central config file.
* Apps and Terraform can **read/write configuration** from this KV store.

---

### 🧰 When to Use Consul?

> “**If you have many microservices or container apps** working together…”

Consul is very helpful when you’re working in a **microservices architecture** or **service-oriented architecture (SOA)** — especially when you deal with **hundreds or thousands of small services** that need to discover each other and communicate reliably.

---

### 🤝 How Consul Integrates with Terraform:

1. **Remote Backend**

   * You can use Consul to store your Terraform state remotely.

2. **KV Store**

   * Store variables or config values in Consul’s key-value system.

3. **Consul Provider**

   * You can manage Consul resources (like services, keys, etc.) directly using Terraform.

---

### 🔁 Summary (In Simple Terms):

| Feature                  | What it means                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Service Discovery** | Who is where? Ask Consul to find other services       |
| 🔄 **Service Mesh**      | Manages traffic securely and smartly between services |
| ⚙️ **App Config**        | Store and manage app settings in Consul’s KV store    |

### **What is HashiCorp Vault?**

Vault is a tool used to **securely access secrets** from different secret stores (places where secrets like passwords, API keys, etc., are saved).

---

### **Where is Vault used?**

Vault is installed (deployed) on a server where:

* **Vault Admins** can directly manage secrets (like passwords, keys, etc.).
* **Operators (developers)** can get secrets using an API.

---

### **What can Vault do?**

Vault provides a **single, unified interface** (one way to work with all secrets):

* You can connect to **any secret** source like:

  * **AWS Secrets**
  * **Consul Key Value**
  * **Google Cloud KMS**
  * **Azure Service Principals**
  * ...and more

* **Access control** features:

  * **Just-in-Time (JIT)**: Limits the time a secret can be accessed. This reduces the risk of attack.
  * **Just Enough Privilege (JeP)**: Gives only the permissions that are necessary. This minimizes damage if compromised.

* **Audit logging**:

  * Vault records everything in a **detailed log** to track access and detect tampering.

---

### **Diagram Explanation**

* **Secrets Engines**: These are plugins used to manage different kinds of secrets (like database credentials, API keys, etc.).

  * Examples shown: KMIP, databases, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.

* **Vault Cluster**: Vault runs on **multiple servers in a group (cluster)** for high availability.

  * It can be **deployed on Virtual Machines**, and Vault can take **snapshots** to back up data.

* **Resources**: Represent things like applications or users that access the secrets.

---

Let me know if you’d like a comparison with tools like AWS Secrets Manager or examples of using Vault commands!
Here’s a **simple and clear explanation** of everything shown in the second image **without removing any content**, just making it easy to understand:

---

### **Terraform and Vault**

---

#### **Problem:**

When a developer uses **Terraform** to deploy resources to a cloud provider (like **AWS**), they need **AWS credentials** (access key and secret key).

* These credentials are usually **long-lived**, meaning they stay active until manually deleted.
* They are stored on the developer’s **local machine**.
* This makes the machine a **target for attackers** who might steal the credentials.

---

#### **What if we could:**

* **Provide credentials Just-In-Time (JIT)** – only when needed.
* **Expire them quickly** after use (make them short-lived).

This would:

* Reduce the time credentials exist on the system.
* Lower the **risk of credentials being stolen** (smaller “attack surface area”).

---

### **Solution using Vault:**

* Vault can **inject these short-lived credentials** during `terraform apply`.
* This is done using **Vault Data Sources**.
* Instead of storing static AWS credentials, Vault gives Terraform the credentials **only when needed**, then they **expire**.

---

#### **Diagram (explained):**

1. Vault injects short-lived credentials.
2. Developer runs Terraform.
3. Terraform connects to cloud providers (like AWS, Azure, etc.).
4. Credentials are gone soon after use.

---

### ✅ **Key takeaway:**

> **Vault helps secure Terraform deployments** by dynamically injecting **temporary secrets** only when needed, which improves security.

Here’s a **simple explanation** of the fourth image titled **“Atlantis”**, with **no content removed**, just made easy to understand:

---

### **Atlantis**

---

#### **What is Atlantis?**

* Atlantis is an **open-source developer tool**.
* It is used to **automate Terraform pull requests**.

👉 This means when someone opens a **Pull Request (PR)** to change Terraform code in a Git repo (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), Atlantis automatically runs `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

---

#### **Website:**

➡️ [https://www.runatlantis.io](https://www.runatlantis.io)

---

### **How it Works (Image in center):**

* When a developer pushes code to a branch, Atlantis:

  1. Detects the change.
  2. Automatically **comments on the pull request** with the result of `terraform plan`.
  3. You can review and approve the plan.
  4. Once approved, Atlantis runs `terraform apply` and applies the changes.

---

#### **Example Comment:**

* Shows which resources are added/changed/destroyed.
* A message like **“Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed”** appears.
* After the PR is merged, you get a **confirmation** message like “Pull request successfully merged and closed.”

---

### **Extra Info (bottom strip in red):**

* Atlantis was made as an **alternative to Terraform Cloud automation**.
* The **creators of Atlantis now work at HashiCorp**, and HashiCorp maintains Atlantis.

---

### ✅ **Key Takeaway:**

> **Atlantis automates the Terraform workflow** in teams using pull requests — reducing manual steps and increasing security.

---

Let me know if you want help setting up Atlantis with GitHub and Terraform!
Here’s a **simple and clear explanation** of the fifth image titled **“CDK for Terraform”**, with **nothing removed**, just simplified for easy understanding:

---

### **CDK for Terraform**

---

#### ✅ What is CDK?

* **CDK = Cloud Development Kit**
* It is an **Imperative** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

  * Imperative means you **write step-by-step instructions** (like regular programming).
* It works using SDKs for your **favorite programming languages** like:

  * TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go

---

#### ☁️ **AWS CDK**

* AWS CDK is made only for **AWS resources**.
* It creates **CloudFormation (CFN) templates** internally.
* These templates are then used for deploying infrastructure.

---

#### 🛠️ **CDK for Terraform (by HashiCorp)**

* This is a separate tool created by HashiCorp.
* It lets you use **CDK-style coding**, but instead of generating CloudFormation templates, it generates **Terraform templates**.

---

#### 🔁 What does this mean?

You can now:

* Use **familiar languages** (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
* Write infrastructure as code
* Generate **Terraform configurations** automatically

This lets you:

> Use CDK-style code to define infrastructure for **any provider** (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, etc.) — not just AWS.

---

### 📊 Diagram (explained):

1. You start with your programming language (TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go).
2. It uses **CDK for Terraform** to convert your code.
3. That gets turned into Terraform configuration files.
4. Terraform then uses these to provision resources in:

   * AWS
   * Azure
   * Google Cloud
   * VMware
   * ServiceNow
   * And **1000+ other providers**

---

### ✅ **Key Benefit:**

> You can write infrastructure using your favorite programming language and deploy it anywhere Terraform supports — thanks to **CDK for Terraform**.

Here’s a **simple and clear explanation** of the image titled **“Terragrunt”**, with no content removed—just made easy to understand:

---

### **Terragrunt**

---

#### ✅ What is Terragrunt?

* **Terragrunt** is a **thin wrapper** for **Terraform**.
* It adds **extra tools** to make Terraform usage more powerful and clean.

---

### 🛠️ Terragrunt helps with:

* **Keeping your configurations DRY**
  (DRY = Don’t Repeat Yourself — write reusable, minimal code)

* **Working with multiple Terraform modules**
  (Makes it easier to manage big infrastructures split into smaller parts)

* **Managing remote state**
  (Centralizes the tracking of resource states — so everyone sees the same version)

---

📎 **Official website:**
[https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io)

---

### 🔁 What is “DRY”?

* **Don’t-Repeat-Yourself (DRY)** is a **programming methodology**.

* It means:

  > Avoid writing the same code in multiple places.
  > Instead, reuse it using **functions, modules, or isolated files**.

* This helps:

  * Reduce **errors**
  * Keep code **clean and simple**
  * Make changes **easier** and **less risky**

---

### 📂 Diagram (Bottom Left)

* Multiple modules like `frontend-app` and `mysql` each have:

  * Their own `main.tf` (Terraform code)
  * A shared or specific `terragrunt.hcl` (Terragrunt config)
* Terragrunt makes it easy to **organize and reuse settings** across modules.

---

### ✅ **Key takeaway:**

> **Terragrunt** makes Terraform more manageable by reducing repetition, organizing config files, and simplifying state and module management.

---

Let me know if you want an example folder structure using Terragrunt and Terraform together!
Here's an **easy-to-understand explanation** of the Terragrunt slide you uploaded—**without removing any content**, just simplifying it:

---

### **Terragrunt — Dynamic Provider Values**

---

### 🔍 What does this slide explain?

Terraform has some limitations.
One of them is **not being able to dynamically set provider values** (like region) **at runtime**.

Terragrunt helps solve this limitation.

---

### ✅ What Terragrunt can do here:

* **Provide dynamic values to a provider**
  This means you can change values like `region` **based on logic or conditions**, which Terraform alone doesn’t support easily.

* **Reduce boilerplate**
  You write less code by reusing Terragrunt blocks across multiple modules.

* **Improve module granularity**
  Makes it easier to manage many small modules (instead of a few large, complex ones).

* **Support unit testing for infrastructure**
  Helps when you want to **test your infra as code** in small parts.

---

### 🧠 Code Breakdown (Right Side):

```hcl
terraform {
  source = "tfr://terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws?version=3.5.0"
}
```

* Specifies which Terraform **module** to use (here, the VPC module from the Terraform registry).

---

```hcl
generate "provider" {
  path = "provider.tf"
  if_exists = "overwrite_terragrunt"
  contents = <<EOF
  provider "aws" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
  EOF
}
```

* Dynamically **creates a provider block** for AWS with the region `"us-east-1"`.
* Saved in a file `provider.tf` during runtime.

---

```hcl
inputs = {
  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
  ...
}
```

* Passes input variables like `VPC name`, `CIDR`, and subnet info to the Terraform module.

---

### 🔑 Key Benefit:

> With **Terragrunt**, you can dynamically create and configure provider settings — **something Terraform alone can’t do**.

---

Let me know if you want a real example folder structure using this approach!
This pyramid diagram explains **different levels of testing in Terraform**, starting from basic static checks to full system (end-to-end) tests. Let me break down each layer **from bottom to top** with real-world meaning, tools, and examples:

---

## 🟨 **1. Static Analysis (Base layer – No deployment)**

### **What it is:**

Check your Terraform code **before deployment**, to catch issues early.

### **Tools used:**

* `tflint`: Checks for style issues, unused declarations, wrong syntax, etc.
* `terraform validate`: Checks if the configuration is syntactically correct and internally consistent.
* `terraform plan`: Shows the changes Terraform will make without applying them.
* `terraform-compliance`: Validates if your Terraform code follows organizational rules (e.g., no open security groups).
* `Sentinel`: HashiCorp’s policy-as-code framework (available in Terraform Enterprise/Cloud).

### ✅ **Goal:**

Prevent misconfigurations, typos, or policy violations **before creating any real cloud resource**.

---

## 🟩 **2. Unit Tests (Smallest unit of code)**

### **What it is:**

Test **a single module** in isolation.

### **Why?**

Infrastructure should be broken into reusable small modules (like VPC, IAM, EC2), and you test each module individually.

### **Tools used:**

* `Terratest`: Written in Go. Provisions real infrastructure and validates it.
* `Kitchen-Terraform`: Uses Test Kitchen + Terraform + InSpec to verify infrastructure.
* `InSpec`: Test infrastructure security and compliance rules.

### ✅ **Goal:**

Make sure **each individual module works** as expected.

---

## 🟦 **3. Integration Tests**

### **What it is:**

Test **multiple modules together**, as a **group or full stack**.

### **Why?**

Real systems are not built from one module. Example: VPC + EC2 + LoadBalancer + IAM need to be tested together to ensure compatibility.

### **Tool used:**

* `Terratest` is most common here too.

### ✅ **Goal:**

Verify that **modules interact correctly** when combined.

---

## 🔷 **4. End-to-End (e2e) Tests (Top level)**

### **What it is:**

Test the **entire infrastructure environment** in a persistent, real-world scenario.

### **Why?**

Validate production-level behavior like:

* Can users log in?
* Does the app load through the Load Balancer?
* Are data backups working?

### **Setup Needed:**

* Full environment creation
* Real-time services
* External integrations

### ✅ **Goal:**

Simulate a **real production workflow** to ensure everything works perfectly.

---

| Unit Test       | Smallest module works as expected               | `Terratest`, `InSpec`, `Kitchen` | ✅ Yes (in sandbox) |
| Integration     | Many modules working well **together**          | `Terratest`                      | ✅ Yes              |
| e2e Test        | Entire infra system is behaving like production | Custom + `Terratest`             | ✅ Yes              |

Let me know if you'd like real examples or a GitHub project that includes all these types of Terraform testing.
This slide expands on the **Testing in Terraform** pyramid you previously saw — by giving a **comparison table** of all four testing techniques. It summarizes their **strengths and weaknesses**, helping you understand when and why to use each method.

### 🔍 **Comparison Table Breakdown**

| **Technique**         | **Strengths**                                                                  | **Weaknesses**                                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Static Analysis**   | 1. Fast<br>2. Stable<br>3. No need to deploy real resources<br>4. Easy to use  | 1. Very limited in errors you can catch<br>2. Doesn’t build strong confidence  |
| **Unit Tests**        | 1. Fast enough (1–10 min)<br>2. Mostly stable<br>3. High confidence in modules | 1. Need to deploy real resources<br>2. Non-trivial code required               |
| **Integration Tests** | 1. Mostly stable<br>2. High confidence in **multiple units working together**  | 1. Need real resources<br>2. Harder code<br>3. Slower (10–30 min)              |
| **End-to-End Tests**  | 1. Build confidence in **entire architecture**                                 | 1. Needs full infra<br>2. Hard to write<br>3. Slow (60–240 min!)<br>4. Brittle |

### 🔁 How This Complements the Pyramid:

* The **higher you go up** the pyramid:

  * The more **realistic and confidence-building** the test is.
  * But also more **complex, slower, and harder to maintain**.
* The **lower levels (Static, Unit)** are **fast and lightweight**.
* A solid Terraform test strategy usually includes **all layers**, depending on:

  * **Speed vs Confidence** trade-off
  * **Stage** (Dev/QA/Prod)

---

### 🧠 Real-World Tip:

* Use **static analysis** + **unit tests** in every CI run.
* Run **integration** and **e2e** only on PR merges or nightly builds to save cost/time.

---

Let me know if you want a sample `.tflint.hcl`, Terratest Go test, or GitHub workflow that runs tests automatically.
This slide introduces **TerraTest**, a popular framework to test Terraform code using **Go** (Golang). Here's a complete explanation:

---

### ✅ **What is TerraTest?**

**TerraTest** is a **Go-based testing framework** developed by Gruntwork, designed to:

* **Perform Unit Tests** and **Integration Tests** on infrastructure.
* Allow you to **automate testing** of Terraform modules and infrastructure deployments.

---

### 🧪 **What Does TerraTest Do?**

It helps test IaC (Infrastructure as Code) by:

1. **Temporarily deploying** the Terraform code (like creating resources).
2. **Validating the deployment** (e.g., check if an EC2 instance is running, URL is reachable).
3. **Destroying the infrastructure** once tests are done (so you don’t incur cloud costs).

---

### 🧠 **Why is TerraTest Important?**

* Helps **verify correctness** of your Terraform code before deploying to production.
* Supports **DRY** and **automated CI/CD pipelines**.
* **Written in Golang** – but you only need basic syntax knowledge to use it effectively.

---

### 🔤 **Code Snippet Explanation**

```go
func validateHelloWorldApp(t *testing.T, terraformOptions *terraform.Options) {
    url := terraform.Output(t, terraformOptions, "url")

    expectedStatus := 200
    expectedBody := "Hello, World!"
    maxRetries := 10
    timeBetweenRetries := 3 * time.Second

    http_helper.HttpGetWithRetry(t, url, nil, expectedStatus, expectedBody, maxRetries, timeBetweenRetries)
}
```

#### 📌 What it does:

* **Runs `terraform output`** to get the deployed app URL.
* **Checks** if the app returns:

  * HTTP status `200` (Success)
  * Response body: `"Hello, World!"`
* Retries the test **10 times**, waiting 3 seconds between attempts (to allow slow startup times).

---

### 🔧 Real Usage in CI/CD

You can integrate TerraTest with:

* **GitHub Actions**
* **GitLab CI**
* **Jenkins**
* etc., to validate Terraform deployments automatically before merging code.

### 💡 Summary

| Feature              | TerraTest Benefit                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Language             | Written in Go (simple to use, fast execution)      |
| Unit + Integration   | Supports both types of testing                     |
| Deployment Lifecycle | Automates `apply`, test validations, and `destroy` |
| Infra Quality        | Catches issues early — before real deployments     |

Let me know if you'd like a **sample TerraTest repo** or **GitHub Action workflow** for it.
