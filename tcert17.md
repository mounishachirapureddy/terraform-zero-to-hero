Here's a **clear and complete explanation** of the image you shared on **Cloud Backend** in Terraform — with **no content removed** and everything explained simply:

## ☁️ **Cloud Backend** (Terraform Cloud)

Terraform Cloud can be used as a **remote backend** to manage your state files and collaborate with your team in a centralized and secure way.

This image shows **two methods** for configuring Terraform Cloud as the backend:

---

### 🔴 **Old/Traditional Way** — Using `backend "remote"` Block

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "remote" {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "company"

    workspaces {
      prefix = "my-app-"
    }
  }
}
```

* This uses the `backend "remote"` block.
* You specify:

  * `hostname`: usually `app.terraform.io` for Terraform Cloud.
  * `organization`: the name of your Terraform Cloud organization.
  * `workspaces`: to manage multiple environments with a **prefix** (e.g., `my-app-dev`, `my-app-prod`).
* ⚠️ This method **still works** but is now considered **less preferred**.

---

### ✅ **Recommended Way** — Using `cloud` Block

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "company"
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```

* This uses the newer `cloud` block introduced by Terraform.
* It is **more straightforward and modern** for Terraform Cloud users.
* You specify:

  * `organization`: your Terraform Cloud org.
  * `hostname`: typically `app.terraform.io`.
  * `tags`: lets you tag and filter workspaces (e.g., all workspaces tagged with `"app"`).

---

### ⚠️ Important Note (bottom of the image):

> You can still use `backend remote` for Terraform Cloud, but it’s **recommended** to use the `cloud` backend block.

---

### 🧠 Why switch to the `cloud` block?

* Cleaner syntax
* Native to Terraform Cloud workflows
* Easier to manage and maintain
* Automatically handles remote state, CI/CD, team permissions, etc.
